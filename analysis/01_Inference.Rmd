# Chapter 1: Inference

For these exercises, we will be using the following dataset:

```{r setup, include=TRUE}
library(downloader)
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/genomicsclass/dagdata/master/inst/extdata/femaleControlsPopulation.csv"
filename <- basename(url)
download(url, destfile=filename)
x <- unlist( read.csv(filename) )
write.csv(x, "data/femaleControlsPopulation.csv")
```

Here x represents the weights for the entire population.
