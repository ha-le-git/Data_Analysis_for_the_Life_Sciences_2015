This website contains the analysis code for all exercises in the book "Data Analysis_for_the_Life Sciences_2015" 
by Rafael Irizarry and Michael Love. The code is organized in the same way as the book, with each chapter 
containing a separate R Markdown file. The code is written in R and uses the tidyverse suite of packages 
for data manipulation and visualization. The website is built using the workflowr package, which provides a 
framework for organizing and sharing data analysis projects. The website is hosted on GitHub Pages, and the 
source code is available on GitHub. 

The chapters covered in this website include:  
1. [Chapter 1: Inference](01_Inference.html)
